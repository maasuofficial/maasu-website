          MAASUx is a regional event, coordinated in collaboration with a campus
          host organization, designed to create additional opportunities to
          engage the midwest APIDA student community. MAASUx is a free event
          designed to attract college students from surrounding campuses to
          participate in educational workshops and fun activities. Through the
          more intimate setting of MAASUx programs, students can engage in
          creating high-quality connections with their peers and have the
          opportunity to reflect on their intersecting identities and
          experiences. These events are normally attended by 50-100 students.
        </p>

          MAASUx was initially launched in 2010 as MAASU Mixers before changing
          its name in summer 2016. Each MAASUx event began having a programming
          theme in 2017.
