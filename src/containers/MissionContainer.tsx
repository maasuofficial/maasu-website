          The Midwest Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Students Union
          (MAASU) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that began in response
          to a need for political unity among Asian Pacific Islander American
          students in the Midwest. By 1990, there were more than 20 universities
          in the Midwest that had formed Asian Pacific Islander American (APIA)
          organizations. Some had been around for years, while others were still
          in their infancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students felt a need for an organization that would support the growth
          of their groups and organize Midwestern Asian Pacific Islander
          American students for political activism. MAASU works to recognize the
          needs of the Asian Pacific Islander American community by assisting
          schools with the establishment of Asian Pacific Islander American
          student organizations, promoting leadership among students, addressing
          educational needs and rights of the Asian Pacific Islander American
          community, and developing a channel of communication among Asian
          Pacific Islander American student organizations across the Midwest.
