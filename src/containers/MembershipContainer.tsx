          All members schools will select a MAASU Representative. MReps, for
          short, are the official liaison between member schools and the MAASU
          Executive Coordinating Committee (ECC). As stated in the MAASU
          constitution, each school may only have one MRep. The roles, duties,
          and responsibilities of the MRep consists of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Respond to emails and messages from MAASU Communications chairs or
            other members of the ECC when necessary
          </li>
          <li>
            Update their school’s APIDA organizations on MAASU information
            regarding campaigns, conferences, and fundraisers
          </li>
          <li>
            Has the power to submit one vote for conference bids, ECC elections,
            and constitutional changes
          </li>
          <li>Help elect the ECC for the upcoming year</li>
          <li>
            Has the power to accept or decline amendments made to the
            constitution
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Voting requires a two-thirds attendance in order to reach quorum.
          MReps will serve a full academic year in conjunction with the
          communications chairs. Should any MRep need to step down for any
          reasons, the institution must replace the MRep and connect them
          immediately with the communications chairs for updates.
