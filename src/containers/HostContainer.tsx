          Every fall, MAASU hosts a Leadership Summit, catered to 150-200
          students, and every spring, MAASU hosts a Spring Conference,
          accommodating over 700 attendees. Each conference brings to light the
          history, challenges, and initiatives that the Asian Pacific Islander
          Desi American community faces. Each year, these conferences are hosted
          at different schools, allowing for the students around the Midwest to
          travel, explore, and gain a further understanding of the resources
          that their peers have. In addition, each host school showcases the
          talent of its students and local community through performances,
          workshops, and keynotes. Each conference closes with a banquet, and
          the Spring Conference also recognizes particular members in the
          community.

            <p>
              All interested schools are required to create a bid packet. The
              purpose of this bid packet is to showcase why the school should
              host the conference and provide an overview of the planning
              logistics. Bid packets on average are around 20 pages long and
              need to include the sections outlined in the requirements:
