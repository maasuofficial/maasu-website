          MAASU strives to tell the story of Asian Pacific Islander Desi
          Americans in the Midwest through the #whereareyoufrom project. The
          project’s main goal is to combat the question "Where are you from?"
          that many APIDAs are are constantly asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          This question identifies APIDAs as foreigners in their own home,
          making them perpetual foreigners when they are not. The
          #whereareyoufrom project collects the stories of individuals across
          the Midwest through videos, audio and written stories. The stories we
          have collected range from working professionals to students, family,
          and friends who grew up in the Midwest.
