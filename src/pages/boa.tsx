          The Board of Advisors is a group of volunteers (working professionals
          with 5+ years or more of experience) with knowledge of and interest in
          the APIDA Community. Advisors have prior experience working with or
          advising a student organization, and have a strong understanding of
          the Midwest APIDA experience. The board serves as a resource to advise
          the Directors Council (DC) and Executive Director (ED).
